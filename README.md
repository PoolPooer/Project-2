Wasp Exterminator!

Wasp Exterminator is tricky game that looks easy. The aim of the game is to stop all the wasps from getting the to left hand side of the screen.
This is easier said than done as the location, size and speed of the wasps are completely random.

This game is targeted to anyone who enjoys point and click games and is looking to kill some time.

Features

The navigation is very simple as the game consists of a homepage, a how to play and the main game page.

Once the game starts it spawns in some wasps instantly and it is up to the player to stop them by clicking on the wasps. Once clicked upon,
the player earns one point which is added to the score in the top left of the screen. A sound effect and additional visual effect occur on successful hits.

Ideas for future features:

In the future I would like to add additional enemys and perhaps the ability to slow the game down for a few seconds using power ups.

I had an issue with the hit boxes for the wasps but resolved it by changed the opacity on the second canvas layer.
